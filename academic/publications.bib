  abstract = {The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has led to
              the need for flexible and user-friendly data pre-processing
              platforms. The Pipeliner framework provides an out-of-the-box
              solution for processing various types of sequencing data. It
              combines the Nextflow scripting language and Anaconda package
              manager to generate modular computational workflows. We have used
              Pipeliner to create several pipelines for sequencing data
              processing including bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq),
              as well as Digital Gene Expression (DGE) data. This report
              highlights the design methodology behind Pipeliner which enables
              the development of highly flexible and reproducible pipelines that
              are easy to extend and maintain on multiple computing environments.
              We also provide a quick start user guide demonstrating how to setup
              and execute available pipelines with toy datasets.},

  abstract = {Abstract Naturally occurring microbial communities often comprise
              thousands of taxa involved in complex networks of interactions.
              These interactions can be mediated by several mechanisms, including
              the competition for resources, the exchange of signals and
              nutrients, cell-cell contact and antibiotic warfare. In addition to
              direct measurements and computational predictions of interactions,
              abundant data on microbial co-occurrence associations can be
              inferred from correlations of taxa across samples, which can be
              estimated from metagenomic, and amplicon datasets. The analysis and
              interpretation of interaction and correlation networks are limited
              by the challenge of comparing across different datasets, due to
              heterogeneity of the data itself and to the lack of a platform to
              facilitate such comparisons. Here, we introduce the Microbial
              Interaction Network Database (MIND) - a web-based platform for the
              integrative analysis of different types of microbial networks,
              freely available at http://microbialnet.org/ . In addition to
              containing a growing body of curated data, including amplicon-based
              co-occurrence networks, genome-scale model-derived networks,
              metabolic influence networks and horizontal gene transfer networks,
              MIND allows users to upload and analyze newly generated networks
              using a JSON format and standard NCBI taxonomy. The platform
              provides convenient functions to compare and query multiple
              networks simultaneously, and to visualize and export networks and
              datasets. Through some illustrative examples, we demonstrate how
              the platform might facilitate discoveries and help generate new
              hypotheses on host-associated and environmentally important
              microbial ecosystems through the power of knowledge integration.},

              organize into communities consisting of hundreds of species
              involved in complex interactions with each other. 16S ribosomal RNA
              (16S rRNA) amplicon profiling provides snapshots that reveal the
              phylogenies and abundance profiles of these microbial communities.
              These snapshots, when collected from multiple samples, have the
              potential to reveal which microbes co-occur, providing a glimpse
              into the network of associations in these communities. The
              inference of networks from 16S data is prone to statistical
              artifacts. There are many tools for performing each step of the 16S
              analysis workflow, but the extent to which these steps affect the
              final network is still unclear. In this study, we perform a
              meticulous analysis of each step of a pipeline that can convert 16S
              sequencing data into a network of microbial associations. Through
              this process, we map how different choices of algorithms and
              parameters affect the co-occurrence network and estimate steps that
              contribute most significantly to the variance. We further determine
              the tools and parameters that generate the most accurate and robust
              co-occurrence networks based on comparison with mock and synthetic
              datasets. Ultimately, we develop a standardized pipeline that
              follows these default tools and parameters, but that can also help
              explore the outcome of any other combination of choices. We
              envisage that this pipeline for processing 16S sequencing data into
              networks of microbial co-occurrences could be used for integrating
              multiple data-sets, and for generating comparative analyses and
              consensus networks that can help understand and control microbial
              community assembly in different biomes. The pipeline is available
              as a Python package at https://github.com/segrelab/MiCoNE{$<$}/p{

              are intrinsically noisy and this noise may determine the
              qualitative outcome of the system. In the absence of analytical
              solutions to mathematical models incorporating noise, stochastic
              simulation algorithms are useful to explore the possible
              trajectories of these systems. Algorithms used for such stochastic
              simulations include the Gillespie algorithm and its approximations.
              In this study we introduce cayenne, an easy to use Python package
              containing accurate and fast implementations of the Gillespie
              algorithm (direct method), the tau-leaping algorithm and a
              tau-adaptive algorithm. We compare the accuracy of cayenne with
              other stochastic simulation libraries (BioSimulator.jl,
              GillespieSSA and Tellurium) and find that cayenne offers the best
              trade-off between accuracy and speed. Additionally, we highlight
              the importance of performing accuracy tests for stochastic
              simulation libraries, and hope that it becomes standard practice
