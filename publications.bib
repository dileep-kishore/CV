  abstract = {The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has led to the need for flexible and user-friendly data pre-processing platforms. The Pipeliner framework provides an out-of-the-box solution for processing various types of sequencing data. It combines the Nextflow scripting language and Anaconda package manager to generate modular computational workflows. We have used Pipeliner to create several pipelines for sequencing data processing including bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), as well as Digital Gene Expression (DGE) data. This report highlights the design methodology behind Pipeliner which enables the development of highly flexible and reproducible pipelines that are easy to extend and maintain on multiple computing environments. We also provide a quick start user guide demonstrating how to setup and execute available pipelines with toy datasets.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Microbes tend to organize into communities consisting of hundreds of species involved in complex interactions with each other. 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) amplicon profiling provides snapshots that reveal the phylogenies and abundance profiles of these microbial communities. These snapshots, when collected from multiple samples, have the potential to reveal which microbes co-occur, providing a glimpse into the network of associations in these communities. The inference of networks from 16S data is prone to statistical artifacts. There are many tools for performing each step of the 16S analysis workflow, but the extent to which these steps affect the final network is still unclear. In this study, we perform a meticulous analysis of each step of a pipeline that can convert 16S sequencing data into a network of microbial associations. Through this process, we map how different choices of algorithms and parameters affect the co-occurrence network and estimate steps that contribute most significantly to the variance. We further determine the tools and parameters that generate the most accurate and robust co-occurrence networks based on comparison with mock and synthetic datasets. Ultimately, we develop a standardized pipeline that follows these default tools and parameters, but that can also help explore the outcome of any other combination of choices. We envisage that this pipeline for processing 16S sequencing data into networks of microbial co-occurrences could be used for integrating multiple data-sets, and for generating comparative analyses and consensus networks that can help understand and control microbial community assembly in different biomes. The pipeline is available as a Python package at https://github.com/segrelab/MiCoNE{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Biological systems are intrinsically noisy and this noise may determine the qualitative outcome of the system. In the absence of analytical solutions to mathematical models incorporating noise, stochastic simulation algorithms are useful to explore the possible trajectories of these systems. Algorithms used for such stochastic simulations include the Gillespie algorithm and its approximations. In this study we introduce cayenne, an easy to use Python package containing accurate and fast implementations of the Gillespie algorithm (direct method), the tau-leaping algorithm and a tau-adaptive algorithm. We compare the accuracy of cayenne with other stochastic simulation libraries (BioSimulator.jl, GillespieSSA and Tellurium) and find that cayenne offers the best trade-off between accuracy and speed. Additionally, we highlight the importance of performing accuracy tests for stochastic simulation libraries, and hope that it becomes standard practice when developing the same.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The cayenne package can be found at https://github.com/Heuro-labs/cayenne while the bench-marks can be found at https://github.com/Heuro-labs/cayenne-benchmarks{$<$}/p{$>$}},
